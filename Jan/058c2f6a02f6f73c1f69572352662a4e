Las Vegas’ Hard Rock Hotel & Casino will close its doors Feb. 3, capping 25 years of rockin’ memories and making way for the newest Virgin Hotel. Of course, it won’t end without a party. The Last Great Party  from Jan. 30  through Feb. 2 will celebrate the hotel’s final chapter in Vegas. Each afternoon, live music will start at 4 p.m. at the Center Bar, Fu Asian Kitchen and Peacock Lounge. The Growlers will be the last artists to perform in the Vinyl showroom, Jan. 30 through Feb. 1. Tickets start at $45; doors open at 8 p.m.  Guests who want to stay to the bitter end can party until 3 a.m. Feb. 3. After that, the doors will be locked until the rebranded property reopens in late fall. So what happened in those two and a half decades? The brand’s love of  Las Vegas started before the hotel opened.
