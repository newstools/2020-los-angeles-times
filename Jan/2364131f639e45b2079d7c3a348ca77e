The chicken in this keto dish is baked in olive brine, so it doesn’t need extra salt. Be sure to taste the dish before adding any salt at the end. If you have mixed olives you want to use but no brine, simply season the chicken with salt before adding to the dish and pour over 1/2 cup chicken stock or water in its place. From the story: Olive brine is the miracle ingredient to perfectly season chicken thighs
