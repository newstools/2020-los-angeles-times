Trees can solve so many problems. On the hottest of summer days, their evergreen canopies cool our homes and streets and shelter us from ultraviolet rays. Anyone who has gotten lost in the intricate details of an ancient African Cape chestnut tree in Elysian Park or the thick bark of a coast live oak in La Cañada Flintridge knows they are magical too. As the coronavirus pandemic drags on, and we are constrained in our travels, L.A.’s urban forest — and the allure of the outdoors — feels more important than ever.  Trees may not be able to solve all our problems, but they can offer a reprieve from the isolation and anxiety that come  with COVID-19. Here are a few of our favorite places to find shade in L.A. this summer. Have a  favorite of your own? Let us know and we’ll add it to the list.
