When plant stores were forced to close in March because of the coronavirus, many had to get creative  so that they could accommodate the soaring demand for plants as people sheltered  at home. For plant lovers who view nursery visits as therapy, it was a major loss. Sure you can buy houseplants online and at big-box stores, but there’s nothing like buying a plant from someone who offers personalized tips on keeping your newly adopted plant alive. Is your Calathea roseopicta being finicky? Hank Jenkins of the Plant Provacateur has been known to counsel clients after they have purchased a plant from him. “You need to water your ZZ plant every two weeks,” he told a client. “It needs to dry out in between feedings.” The Los Angeles retail plant community is a collegial group with a generous spirit that extends beyond its customers. At Folia Collective, owner Danae Horst recommends Leaf and Spine for rare plants. At Leaf and Spine, Ernestine Segura refers clients to Planta for larger containers. Potted’s Annette Gutierrez is a big fan of Jenkins of the Plant Provocateur, who in turn suggests Sunset Nursery for full-sun plants. Now that stores are beginning to reopen, we decided to list a few of our favorites. Have a preference of your own? Let us know. Because of the pandemic, not all of the businesses on our list will be open, some may have limited hours and some will be offering curbside pickup only. So call or check online before heading out.
